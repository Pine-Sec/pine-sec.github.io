## Late Night Musings – also First post on the new blog!

I always find myself doing these things late at night. Maybe it’s because my 9-5 and 5-9 and 9-midnight blend together, or maybe it’s my ADHD and now is my prime thinking time (ok, maybe not), or maybe it’s just how my brain works.

----------

It was my first ever sales kickoff. The year doesn’t really matter all that much, but I was younger and definitely not as driven or focused as I am now. I worked for, well, let’s call them “The Huge Company.”

The one thing I remember was our guest speaker. He was a Marine (no such thing as former, right?) and he had been shot multiple times—including having his entire jaw shot off in the line of duty. He told us his story, not just his resume. And that stuck with me.

All of that to say…in a sea of buzzwords, sales numbers, graphs, charts, goals, and metrics shared by the CEO, the President, the CTO—those stories are what cut through. That’s what stuck.

## So why did that stick?

I didn’t have the language for it then, but I do now, thanks to my time spent in CTI. To be honest, lately I’ve been diving into “signal-to-noise” ratios. What do people actually remember? I’m trying to figure it out.

### **Stories land hard**

In fact, according to Stanford’s Dr. Jennifer Aaker, stories are up to 22 times more memorable than just facts ([source](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/harnessing-power-stories)). And if you’re trying to persuade people, you should try to tell a story—hard data shows this “soft” skill will make you 35 percent more persuasive ([Inc. article](https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/hard-data-shows-this-soft-skill-will-make-you-35-percent-more-persuasive.html)).

Want to know how many people remember stats? About 5%. Know how many remember a story? **63%** ([The Data Storytelling Process](https://www.klipfolio.com/blog/data-storytelling-process)).

So if I want someone’s attention, if I want someone to act (CISO, stakeholders, that engineer you’re begging to patch the thing that **desperately needs patching**)—you don’t lead with a spreadsheet. You lead with a story. We’re not spreadsheets; we’re walking, talking, pattern-recognition powerhouses, powered by narrative.

## What does our brain do with stories?

You ever notice how people lean in when someone starts with, “You wouldn’t believe what happened…”? That’s not random. When we hear facts, the language centers of our brain light up. When we hear stories, much more of our brain engages—sensory, emotional, and visual areas.

Stories…No wonder we remember them. No wonder they move us. Lt. Col. Justin didn’t just tell us about Huge Company’s mission—he showed us, through his own experiences, how those key points could help build it out.

## Why does this matter to me as a CTI Analyst?

Because we live in charts. We live in reports. We live in IOC reports and ATT&CK matrices and “RiskHeatGraphsThatNobodyReads.png.”

But if we want people to listen, to care, to change behavior—we’ve got to speak human. That means stories.

Tell your SOC lead about what happened to the last company that ignored lateral movement. Share the time your team caught a phishing domain just before a ransomware detonation—and what might have happened if you hadn’t.

Turn your data into narrative. Wrap your logic in emotion.

And listen, this has to apply to our presentations too. AI is getting increasingly better at delivering data. Hell, AI can read data off a PowerPoint if you tell it to. You want to stand out? You want people to remember? Tell a story.

It’s almost 1am now, it’s been dark for hours, and that means I should probably go lay down and toss and turn as I think about the current state of the geopolitical climate. (See: Iranian/Israeli conflict, and so much more.)

Till next time, *May your caffeine be strong, your snacks be tasty, and your intel be a story.*

## Late Night Musings – also First post on the new blog!

I always find myself doing these things late at night. Maybe it’s because my 9-5 and 5-9 and 9-midnight blend together, or maybe it’s my ADHD and now is my prime thinking time (ok, maybe not), but here we are.

----------

It was my first ever sales kickoff. The year doesn’t really matter all that much, but I was younger and definitely not as driven or focused as I am now. I worked for, well, let’s call them “BigCorp”—the kind of place where you have to badge in and out for coffee.

The one thing I remember was our guest speaker. He was a Marine (no such thing as former, right?) and he had been shot multiple times—including having his entire jaw shot off in the line of duty. He spoke about resilience, about grit, about getting back up—literally and figuratively.

All of that to say…in a sea of buzzwords, sales numbers, graphs, charts, goals, and metrics shared by the CEO, the President, the CTO—those stories are what cut through. That’s what stuck.

## So why did that stick?

I didn’t have the language for it then, but I do now, thanks to my time spent in CTI. To be honest, lately I’ve been diving into “signal-to-noise” ratios. What do people actually remember? What do they talk about later? What moves them to act?

### **Stories land hard**

In fact, according to research, stories are up to 22 times more memorable than just facts. And if you’ve ever sat through a dry presentation, you know exactly what I mean.

Want to know how many people remember stats? About 5%. Know how many remember a story? **63%**.

So if I want someone’s attention, if I want someone to act (CISO, stakeholders, that engineer you’re begging to patch the thing that **desperately needs patching**)—you don’t lead with a stat. You lead with a story.

## What does our brain do with stories?

You ever notice how people lean in when someone starts with, “You wouldn’t believe what happened…”? That’s not random. When we hear facts, the language centers of our brain light up. When we hear stories, *multiple* parts of our brain activate—sensory, emotional, and even motor cortexes.

Stories… No wonder we remember them. No wonder they move us. Lt. Col. Justin didn’t just tell us about Huge Company’s mission—he showed us, through his own experiences, how those key points played out in real life.

## Why does this matter to me as a CTI Analyst?

Because we live in charts. We live in reports. We live in IOC reports and ATT&CK matrices and “RiskHeatGraphsThatNobodyReads.png.”

But if we want people to listen, to care, to change behavior—we’ve got to speak human. That means stories.

Tell your SOC lead about what happened to the last company that ignored lateral movement. Share the time your team caught a phishing domain just before a ransomware detonation—and what might have happened if you hadn’t.

Turn your data into narrative. Wrap your logic in emotion.

And listen, this has to apply to our presentations too. AI is getting increasingly better at delivering data. Hell, AI can read data off a PowerPoint if you tell it to. You want to stand out? You need a story.

It’s almost 1am now, it’s been dark for hours, and that means I should probably go lay down and toss and turn as I think about the current state of the geopolitical climate. (See: Iranian/Israeli tensions, election interference, and the latest ransomware group chatter.)

Till next time, *May your caffeine be strong, your snacks be tasty, and your intel be a story.*
